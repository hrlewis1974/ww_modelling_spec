# Introduction

## Purpose

The purpose of this Wastewater Network Modelling Specification is to ensure a consistent standard of wastewater network modelling across Wellington Water Ltd’s (WWL) client councils. Further this specification standardizes the model asset & time vary data inputs formats to link with WWL WW asset management planning process.

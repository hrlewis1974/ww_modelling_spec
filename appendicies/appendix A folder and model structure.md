## Model Database Naming Detail

The networks under the model build sub heading – the subsections should be:

* Networks
  * Named for specific purposes
* Themes
  * Network: To be provided by WWL
  * Design: To be provided by WWL
  * Performance: To be provided by WWL

This structure is also to apply to the remainder of the networks under the project main heading.

The Flow Survey will consist of all the rainfall data that has been collected.

Ground model – as for the flow survey this is relatively “static” information and it is not anticipated that there will be significant sub sections.

Infonet is to be have the following under the main heading:

* Networks
  * The Infonet network used to create the model.
  * A current stormwater.wastewater network
  * A distribution network –Water Meters
  * A collection network with proposed future development sites
* Layers: To be provided by WWL
* Selections: To be provided by WWL
* Overflow Lines: To be discussed with WWL
* Themes: To be provided by WWL
* SQL’s: To be provided by WWL

It is important to note that the items to be provided by WWL are not exhaustive and if the consultant considers these should be amended or other’s added these need to be undertaken in consultation with WWL.

This figure below provides an overview f how the database could be developed:

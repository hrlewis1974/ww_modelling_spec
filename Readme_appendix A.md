| Impermeable Area Survey |  |  |  |  |  |  | In the 1990's a comprehensive survey (50,000 properties) was undertaken to identify property area connected to the wastewater network. It is believed that hard areas connected then were fixed. It is likely that there are still low lying gullies etc. remaining. |
